  <div class="bio">
    <p>Ryan Gregory Tallman is an innovative electronic composer and sound artist whose work explores the boundaries of perception, space, and time. Utilizing electric guitars, field recordings, sampling, and modular synthesis, Tallman crafts intricate aural sculptures that challenge and redefine the listener’s experience of sound. His compositions blur the line between the organic and the synthetic, creating immersive sonic landscapes that are both evocative and thought-provoking.</p>

    <p>A graduate of Mills College, Tallman earned his MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media in 2009. During his time at Mills, he studied under pioneering figures in experimental music, including Pauline Oliveros, Fred Frith, Roscoe Mitchell, and Maggi Payne, whose mentorship profoundly shaped his artistic approach and technical expertise.</p>

    <p>With a prolific output spanning over 20 full-length solo albums and 13 EPs and singles, Tallman has established himself as a relentless explorer of sound. His latest album, <em>Everything Hums</em>, released on May 1st, 2025, on his independent label, Existential Tension Recordings, showcases his mastery of texture and spatial design.</p>

    <p>Rooted in experimentation and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of electronic music, Tallman’s work continues to captivate audiences and critics alike, solidifying his place as a distinctive voice in contemporary sound art.</p>
